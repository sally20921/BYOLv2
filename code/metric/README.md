from "Unsupervised feature learning via non-parametric instance discrimination"

## highlight
- We formulate unsupervised learning from a completely different non-parametric perspective.
- Feature encodings can be as compact as 128 dimension for each image.
- Run seamlessly with nearest neighbor classifier.
